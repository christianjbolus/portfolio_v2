            Hello there!  My name is Christian and I'm passionate about build software products 
            that reduce friction in the lives of users.  I have a tenacious approach to problem 
            solving and am motivated by overcoming challenges and developing efficient solutions.    
          </p>
          <p>
            My background in marketing allows me to view software through a user focused lens. 
            This informs my design decisions from the perspective of the end user and my fellow developers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a fast learner who is able to get along with all personality types and 
            Iâ€™m energized by working with high performance teams that are continually pushing their 
            members to improve and reach their goals.
